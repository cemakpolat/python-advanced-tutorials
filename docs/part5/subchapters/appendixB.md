## Appendix B: Common Go Idioms and Best Practices

This appendix will cover some common Go idioms and best practices to help you write more idiomatic, efficient, and maintainable code.

*   **Error Handling:**
    *   Always check errors explicitly and return them to the caller when possible.
    *   Use descriptive error messages with `fmt.Errorf`.
    *  Wrap errors using `%w` to preserve the original error and providing more context about where it originated.
	*  Use `defer` to make sure that your resources are always closed even when an error occurs.
    *   Avoid using panics for recoverable errors.
*   **Concurrency:**
    *   Use goroutines for concurrent operations, but use them wisely as they can consume memory.
    *   Use channels to communicate between goroutines. Avoid using shared memory whenever possible.
    *  When accessing shared memory, use mutexes to prevent race conditions.
	*  Always use a `WaitGroup` to prevent the program from exiting before your goroutines finish their work.
*   **Code Organization:**
    *   Organize your code into small, focused packages, following the single responsibility principle.
    *   Use clear and descriptive names for packages, functions, variables, structs and interfaces.
	*  Use exported functions and variables only when they need to be accessed from another package.
*  **Modularity**: Keep your code as modular as possible, avoiding dependencies between different modules.
*   **Testing:**
    *   Write unit tests for all of your code, including the edge cases and failure scenarios.
    *  Use different test cases to make sure that all the parts of your functions are working correctly.
	* Create test tables when testing different values for the same function.
*   **Code Readability:**
    *   Write clear and easy-to-read code, following Go's formatting conventions (use `go fmt`).
    *   Add clear comments explaining the logic and purpose of functions and types.
	* Choose clear and descriptive names for functions, variables, structs, etc.
*  **Code Documentation**: Use documentation for the packages, functions, and types, so you and other developers can easily understand the code.
*  **Immutability**: Prefer immutability over mutability, as this will make your code less complex and less prone to errors.
*   **Performance:**
    *   Avoid unnecessary memory allocation to reduce the garbage collection overhead.
    *   Use buffered I/O when working with files to improve performance.
    * Use benchmarking to identify bottlenecks and to verify the performance of your code.
	* When working with strings, prefer string operations over string concatenation with the `+` operator.
*   **Packages and Dependencies:**
    *  Always use `go mod tidy` to update and clean the dependencies.
    *   Choose dependencies wisely.
